p You can use the FlowTasting app to schedule your event, invite your guests, and run your tasting in real time.

p During the event, confirmed guests gain access to a private Virtual Tasting Room via their mobile devices.  Everyone rates the wines and, as the host, you see the results as they come in. When everyoneâ€™s ready, you can generate a Group Scorecard to reveal the winners and losers.
